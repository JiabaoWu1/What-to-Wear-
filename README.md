WTWR (What To Wear?)
Project Overview
WTWR is a simple, user-friendly application that provides daily clothing recommendations based on the weather forecast. The app works by calling an API that returns the daily weather data. We then process that data and, based on the forecast, suggest what to wear for the day.

The application is built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5.
